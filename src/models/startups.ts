    desc: `This time I joined a startup in their early stages when they were searching for a CTO. It was a business focused on men's fashion and specifically
to help influencers build their product marketplace and inventory management outside of Instagram or YouTube. We tried to bring together, influencers, brands who wanted to expand their influence and men searching for fashion inspiration. It was a 3 side-marketplace and required perfect coordination between all sides. I was in charge of reviewing business requirements and implementing the following apps:
✔️ Built a landing page for the startup to engage first users.
✔️ Develop a Chrome extension to help users and influencers to capture their products from Instagram and link them with our marketplace.
✔️ Build the marketplace(front and backend side) used by the customers and influencers to capture or build their products portfolio.
✔️ Build an admin application to manage our registered users, app statistics, products inventory and mainly to help our team to populate the marketplace with first data.
✔️ 😔 Sadly, a few weeks before starting yCombinator program (by then I had finished all apps, ready for the launching event), one of our main co-founders left the startup for a better offer. He was the main promotor of the idea and the sales/connections man.

So I paid a developer to build a similar website but with lower fees for advertising and other useful features. When the development was done other 10 copies were launched at the same time by competitors.
I learned the basics of businesses. Also I learned that most of the money will go for development phase, at least at the beginning. So I started a Computer Science degree out of this experience...
