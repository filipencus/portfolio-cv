      Hi ðŸ‘‹
      <br />
      <br />
      My name is Filip and I enjoy designing / developing products using Javascript &
      Typescript.
      Seriously I love those languages. 
      <br />
      First time I read about them I was 12 years old. ðŸŽ‰
      <br />
      <br />
      I have over 10 years of experience in software development building products for B2C and B2B
      markets.
      And currently, I work for Ing-Bank as a software engineer and head of quality assurance(code).
      <br />
      <br />
      In the past, I learn a lot about companies&apos; failures and successes as well. It was a great
      journey.
      I have been involved in all stages... from idea to customer research, product design,
      development, and delivering scalable solutions. âœ¨
      <br />
      <br />
      I work very hard and I am so committed to the promises I make.
      <br />
      And of course, I love startups world, people and innovation... ðŸ’¡
      <br />
      <br />
