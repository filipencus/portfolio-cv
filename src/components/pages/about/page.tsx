      Hi ðŸ‘‹
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm Lone, and I am the maker of this tool.
      <br />
      <br />
      I reside in Copenhagen, where I work with product management. In that role, I often facilitate
      different kinds of creative processes, which is something I really enjoy!
      <br />
      <br />
      During the covid-19 lockdown, when everything suddenly had to be online, I realized how much
      extra effort you have to put into remote facilitation, and I wanted to do something about it!
      <br />
      <br />
      I decided to make a tool that.
      <br />
