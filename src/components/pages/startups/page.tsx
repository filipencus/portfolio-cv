          MY ENTREPRENEUR STORY

      <br />
      Hi üëã
      <br />
      <br />
      My name is Filip and this is my story...
      <br />
      I am a serial entrepreneur and a software engineer with over 10 years of experience building
      web and mobile apps... That&apos;s usually what I do for companies, however, my dream always
      was to build something useful to people, to turn ideas into reality. ‚ú®
      <br />
      <br />
      I was born in Romania but I grew up my whole life in Spain. Also, I lived for a while in
      Wisconsin, USA. My passion for technology started when I was 12 years old. Back then I
      remember reading the first book about Javascript during playtime in School. Of course, I
      didn&apos;t understand anything back then, but at least it helped me to have some ideas about
      programming.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 2014 I graduated in Computer Science in Spain and started working for several startups...
      However, even if I work for tech companies building or extending features, every 2 or 3 years
      I step back for a while and start a business. Working for companies is great but not
      fulfilling, at least not for me. I don&apos;t have the freedom to create, to innovate, or to
      invest in something I believe is worth...
      <br />
      <br />
      I always dreamed of having a business. As a child, I remember writing Microsoft all over the
      place using stickers. I believe that businesses can improve people&apos;s lives in many ways.
      And definitely, that&apos;s my purpose in life. üö¥üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
      <br />
      <br />
      During the journey as you can see (look below timeline) I founded several startups. Most of
      them were failures and some went pretty well.
      <br />
      <br />
      During that time: üí°
      <br />
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>I learned that not only good ideas are necessary but also great execution.</li>
        <li>I learned that not everybody is committed to delivering what they promise.</li>
        <li>
          I learned that building a business is not for everyone. You have to have that
          &quot;virus&quot;, otherwise on the first complication, most people will give up, pretty
          easily.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      Even if 10 businesses fails but one succeeds, you will have the best time in your life.
      It&apos;s something that definitely worth fighting for it. üòÄ

          Most of the products I build are based on JS, TS, NodeJs, React, React Native, NextJs,
          Angular, Ionic, MySQL and AWS as cloud architecture.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          I also did integrations with Pipedrive, Stripe payments, MongoDB, and other dependencies
          we had as a startup...

        <li>
          But for a better overview, just look at my previous startups. You will see all used
